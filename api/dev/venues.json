It serves up quality whimsy, fresh nostalgia and unbridled playfulness in an urban garden atop Odeon Towers in downtown CBD.\n\nLoof was named as a play on the way Singaporeans pronounce ‘roof’, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the idiosyncrasies of local diction and culture. Enjoy a medley of carefully crafted Southeast Asian inspired cocktails and indulge in bar snacks with a local twist. Take a trip down memory lane and bring home little gems of locally-curated nostalgia from The Mama Shop – a postmodern take on classic mom-and-pop shops featuring a selection of new age souvenirs and old-school knick-knacks."

And that’s exactly how it should be. The food is fun and creative, drawing inspiration from Middle Eastern flavors and ingredients; as opposed to being traditional. Imagine funky stuff like doner kebab fried rice, shawarma spiced octopus, honey za’atar fried chicken and baklava soft serve ice cream, all served to a backdrop of 60’s soul and 90’s hip-hop.\n\nIf you wanna get hammered, Artichoke has got the plug with a mean wine list, alongside ice cold beers, ciders, Sunday Punch cocktails and a killer G&T. If that ain’t your thing, or if you’re under aged, don’t break a sweat. The bar at Artichoke also pumps out Turkish sodas, soft serve milkshakes, rosewater lemonade and coffee from our friends Common Man Coffee Roasters."

Our unique space has been adaptively reused to facilitate a wide range of activities and events beyond traditional movie screenings.\n\nThe Projector resides in an oft overlooked piece of local architecture - Golden Mile Tower, a modernist architectural icon of early Singapore. The space calls subtle attention to the past glory of a beloved old cinema. Special elements of the space harken back to its past: vintage signage, original flip-up theatre seats with wooden armrests, fabric walls, and floor lettering denoting the rows of seats have all been retained.\n\nWith a classic cinema hall, an experimental cinema and entertainment space with extended stage, and a sunlit cafe foyer with panoramic city views, The Projector is an ideal setting for a range of traditional or one-of-a-kind events.\n\nEither or both of our halls (left, right) are available for hire, each include use of the Cafe reception/lobby area (below right) for additional space and programming needs. Each hall has been updated and redesigned to facilitate a range of events types. The space is easily accessible via direct elevator from the ground floor.\nVenue packages start from $2,500 based on 4-hour block slots"
